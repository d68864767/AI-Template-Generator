# AI Template Generator

## Description

The AI Template Generator is a tool designed to streamline the process of setting up artificial intelligence models for various tasks. It provides basic templates for different types of AI models, including Classification, Regression, Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction, and Deep Learning, tailored to specific tasks such as Spam Filtering, House Price Prediction, Customer Segmentation, Feature Selection, and Image Recognition.

The generator takes the model type and task as input and outputs a basic template that includes steps for data preprocessing, model definition, model training, and model evaluation.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the generator script with the desired model type and task as arguments.

Example usage:
```
python generator.py Classification Spam Filtering
```

## Input Format

The input to the generator script consists of two lines:

1. The first line is a string indicating the model type (e.g., `Classification`).
2. The second line is a string indicating the task the AI model is supposed to perform (e.g., `Spam Filtering`).

## Output

The output is a basic template for the specified AI model and task, which includes the following sections:

- Data Preprocessing
- Model Definition
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
