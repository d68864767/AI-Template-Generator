```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Data Preprocessing
from data_loader import load_dataset, clean_dataset, split_dataset

# Load Dataset
# Note: The dataset path and loading mechanism may vary based on the actual task and data source.
df = load_dataset("Customer Segmentation")

# Clean Dataset
# This should include any task-specific cleaning steps.
df_cleaned = clean_dataset(df)

# Feature Engineering
# Depending on the task, you may need to perform feature engineering.
# This could include encoding categorical variables, normalizing/standardizing numerical features, etc.
# Here we assume that the features are already numerical and we'll standardize them.
scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df_cleaned)

# Model Definition
# Define the Clustering Model
# The number of clusters (n_clusters) may need to be determined experimentally or based on domain knowledge.
n_clusters = 3  # Example value, should be adjusted based on the specific task
model = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)

# Model Training
# Train Model on the entire dataset
# Clustering is typically an unsupervised task, so we don't usually split into training and test sets.
model.fit(df_scaled)

# Model Evaluation
# Evaluate the clustering performance using silhouette score or other relevant metrics.
# Note: Evaluation metrics for clustering may vary based on the task and dataset characteristics.
labels = model.labels_
silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(df_scaled, labels)
print(f"Silhouette Score: {silhouette_avg:.2f}")

# Save the model and scaler for future use
# You can use joblib or pickle to save the model and scaler objects.
# import joblib
# joblib.dump(model, 'customer_segmentation_kmeans_model.pkl')
# joblib.dump(scaler, 'customer_segmentation_scaler.pkl')

# Note: The above code is a template and may require modifications to fit the specific task and dataset.
