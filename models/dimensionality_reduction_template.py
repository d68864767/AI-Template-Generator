```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from data_loader import load_dataset, clean_dataset, split_dataset

# Data Preprocessing
# Load Dataset
df = load_dataset("Feature Selection")

# Clean Dataset
df_cleaned = clean_dataset(df)

# Standardize Features
scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df_cleaned)

# Split into Training and Test Sets
X_train, X_test = split_dataset(df_scaled)

# Model Definition
# Define Dimensionality Reduction Model
# Adjust the number of components as needed
pca = PCA(n_components=2)

# Model Training
# Train Model on Training Data
pca.fit(X_train)

# Transform the datasets
X_train_pca = pca.transform(X_train)
X_test_pca = pca.transform(X_test)

# Model Evaluation
# The evaluation of a dimensionality reduction model is task-specific and often qualitative.
# For example, one might look at the explained variance ratio or visualize the reduced dimensions.
print("Explained variance ratio:", pca.explained_variance_ratio_)

# Optionally, visualize the reduced dimensions (if 2D or 3D)
# This requires matplotlib, which should be included in requirements.txt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X_train_pca[:, 0], X_train_pca[:, 1])
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.title('PCA on Training Data')
